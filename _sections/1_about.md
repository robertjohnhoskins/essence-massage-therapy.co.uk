**Louise Reynolds** - *RGN, BSc, APNT registered.*

I am a qualified nurse, having had 18 years experience of caring for people. I then trained at the Exeter school of Bodywork, gaining distinction in my holistic Swedish massage diploma in 2015. I have since continued my massage education in order to provide a broad range of therapies to benefit my clients.

**Therapeutic massage helps you by:**

- Easing muscular tension.
- Relieving stress.
- Stimulating the immune system.
- Improving sleep.
- Promoting well being.

I feel so much better after a massage with Louise – relieved of any aches and pains and always totally relaxed! I can recommend Louise for massage without hesitation – she’s brilliant. AT." %}
